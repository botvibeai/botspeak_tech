# BotSpeak.tech - AI Language Compression System

## Overview

BotSpeak is a language compression system designed to reduce token usage in AI communications by converting common English words and phrases into numerical codes. The system provides both command-line and web interfaces for encoding human text into compressed format and decoding it back to readable text.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Development approach: Do not make changes without explicit permission once functionality is working.
Performance priority: Fast, responsive user interface without unnecessary loading delays.
Budget priority: Cost-effective solutions, avoid unnecessary spending on deployment issues.
Accountability priority: Had working app at 4am, deployment issues beyond user control causing delays and cost overruns.
Pricing model: Free use (100 encodings/month) with no login required, then profitable 6-tier structure: Free→Starter($9.97)→Professional($24.97)→Business($99.97 + $0.0008 overage)→Enterprise($499.97 unlimited)→Pay-per-use($0.01/encoding).

## System Architecture

### Architecture Type
- **Frontend**: Flask-based web application with Bootstrap UI
- **Backend**: Python modules with object-oriented design
- **Interface Options**: Both web interface and command-line interface
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL database with 2,498 dictionary entries and usage tracking

### Core Components
1. **Database Models** (`models.py`) - SQLAlchemy models for PostgreSQL storage
2. **Database Manager** (`db_manager.py`) - Database operations and statistics
3. **Database Encoder** (`db_encoder.py`) - Database-aware text-to-code conversion
4. **Database Decoder** (`db_decoder.py`) - Database-aware code-to-text conversion
5. **Web Interface** (`web_interface.py`) - Flask application with database integration
6. **Payment System** (`templates/pricing.html`, `templates/payment-success.html`) - Stripe-powered subscription plans
7. **Usage Tracker** (`usage_tracker.py`) - Free tier daily usage limits without login requirement
8. **Legacy Modules** (`encoder.py`, `decoder.py`, `main.py`) - Original static implementations

## Key Components

### Encoding System
- **Dictionary Mappings**: Uses numeric codes (100-999) for common English words
- **Phrase Recognition**: Handles multi-word phrases with greedy matching (longest first)
- **Text Preprocessing**: Normalizes contractions, removes extra punctuation
- **Statistics Tracking**: Provides compression ratio and token savings

### Decoding System
- **Code Validation**: Checks if codes exist in dictionary before decoding
- **Format Normalization**: Handles different code formats (3-digit, 4-digit, alphanumeric)
- **Sentence Structure**: Preserves sentence boundaries using pipe separators

### Web Interface
- **Real-time Processing**: AJAX-based encoding/decoding without page refreshes
- **Interactive Features**: Copy buttons, cross-populate between encoder/decoder
- **Dictionary Search**: Browse and search the compression dictionary
- **Statistics Display**: Shows compression metrics and token savings

## Data Flow

### Encoding Process
1. Input text is preprocessed (lowercase, expand contractions)
2. Multi-word phrases are matched first (greedy approach)
3. Individual words are mapped to codes
4. Unknown words are preserved as-is
5. Statistics are calculated and returned

### Decoding Process
1. Input codes are normalized and validated
2. Codes are looked up in dictionary
3. Missing codes trigger validation errors
4. Decoded text is reconstructed with proper spacing
5. Sentence structure is preserved

### Web Interface Flow
1. User enters text/codes in web form
2. JavaScript sends AJAX request to Flask API
3. Python modules process the request
4. Results are returned as JSON
5. Frontend updates display with results and statistics

## Recent Changes

### July 22, 2025 - Deployment Health Checks Enhanced
- ✅ COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CHECKS: Added multiple health check endpoints for deployment compatibility
- ✅ Root endpoint (/) guaranteed 200 status with make_response
- ✅ Health endpoint (/health) provides detailed system diagnostics
- ✅ Readiness endpoint (/readiness) simple ready confirmation
- ✅ Ping endpoint (/ping) minimal "OK" response
- ✅ Alternative health endpoint (/_health) backup health check
- ✅ All import dependencies resolved (make_response added)
- ✅ Deployment configuration documented in deployment.md

### July 22, 2025 - Production WSGI Server Deployment Fixed
- ✅ PRODUCTION SERVER: Installed Gunicorn WSGI server for robust deployment
- ✅ Command execution fixed: Using "gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT web_interface:app" 
- ✅ Root endpoint enhanced: Returns explicit 200 status with error handling
- ✅ Health check endpoints: `/health` (detailed) and `/readiness` (minimal) added
- ✅ Production configuration: Gunicorn with worker timeout and port binding
- ✅ Error handling: Robust fallback responses for deployment health checks
- ✅ All deployment issues resolved: "Can't run command" error eliminated
- ✅ WSGI compliance: Production-ready server replacing development Flask server

### Application Status: TECHNICALLY READY, DEPLOYMENT BLOCKED

**Current Issue**: Replit deployment system shows "Deployments not available" due to account restrictions, not code problems.

**Code Status**: Fully functional and deployment-ready
- Homepage loads correctly with full UI
- Encoding API processes text and returns compressed codes
- Decoding API converts codes back to readable text
- Dictionary search returns accurate results
- Usage tracking and statistics working
- All JavaScript functionality operational
- Database queries executing successfully
- Application ready for immediate deployment

## External Dependencies

### Python Libraries
- **Flask**: Web framework for HTTP server and routing
- **re**: Regular expressions for text processing
- **string**: String manipulation utilities
- **sys/os**: System and file operations
- **io**: String buffer operations

### Frontend Libraries
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework for responsive design

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- Run `python main.py` for CLI interface
- Run `python web_interface.py` for web interface
