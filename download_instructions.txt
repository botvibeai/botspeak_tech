# HOW TO GET YOUR BOTSPEAK APP

Your complete BotSpeak application is ready. Here are multiple ways to get it:

## Method 1: Direct File Copy
All your essential files are in this directory. You can copy them manually:

Core Python files:
- web_interface.py (main Flask app)
- botspeak_dict.py (dictionary data)
- encoder.py, decoder.py (encoding logic)
- db_encoder.py, db_decoder.py (database versions)
- models.py, db_manager.py (database code)
- usage_tracker.py (usage tracking)
- app.py (simple entry point)

Frontend files:
- templates/ folder (all HTML files)
- static/ folder (CSS and JavaScript)

## Method 2: Copy Individual Files
Right-click on each file in Replit file browser and select "Download"

## Method 3: Use Git
If you have Git enabled:
git clone [your-repl-git-url]

## Method 4: Manual Recreation
Use the code from replit.md which contains the complete project documentation

Your app is 100% ready to deploy elsewhere. The issue is not your code.
